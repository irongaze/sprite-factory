Big changes

- Revamp code to avoid polluting global namespace by using prefix 'FS' in all class names (e.g. FSModel instead of SpriteModel)
- Revamp textures to be facades over model component's layers

Features

- Global color palette
  - Stored in settings as Data
    - key + hex
  - FSShapes have FSColor
    - stores color key, last color applied (so we can render even if key disappears)
    - consider adding brighten/darken val (i.e. use 'red' at 20% brighten)
  - Build palette widget that displays colors, shows cur selection, always has selection

- Tools
    - Draw - creates new shape, adds points
    - Modify - click point to drag it, ctrl-click to add on segment + drag, shift-click to remove point
    - Move - move shape around, shift-click to add/remove shapes to selection
    - Rotate - rotate shape around, ctrl-click to set center
    - Scale - scale shape around, ctrl-click to set center

- Model
  - Has pixel size in power of 2
  - Owns list of components
  - May have a template image
    - Image has path, scale, offset

- Component
  - One shared list for model
  - Has 3 layers, one for each channel
- ExternalComponent
  - Component subclass
  - Path to ??? (scene file??? json component export?)
  - Attrs: offset, scale, rotation

- Texture
  - Logical grouping of all layers in all components for a given channel
  - Doesn't own data - facades model components into synthetic list of

- Selection
  - Active model - select FactorySprite node to change
  - Active channel - click tab to change
  - Active component - click component to change
  - Active layer (implied by channel + component)
  - 0-n shapes in active component + channel (managed by tools)
